OWASP SecureHeaders Project  

SecureHeaders project consist in two main modules:
1. an engine to scan a list of sites fastly and with minimal resources;
2. a web interface with a dashboard to view, search and customize besides
provide insight and feedback about the use of HTTP secure headers.

HTTP secure headers are resources known to some and despised by others.
However it's a fact that the versatility and security provided by feature can
help make web applications more secure.
